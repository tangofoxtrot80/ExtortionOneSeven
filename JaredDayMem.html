                    <h3>Biography</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>From Jared's Parents, Sam and Keno:</b><br>
                        Jared was the most amazing and loving son a parent could ask for. we always knew that he 
                        would do something great with his life, because he had a fierce determination and a very strong 
                        will to accomplish whatever task he took on. When he was 6 years old, he started talking about 
                        being a soldier and he never once changed his mind about it. So when he joined the U.S. Navy, 
                        we knew he was going to do many great things. Jared had such a fun sense of humor—he loved 
                        making people laugh. He always made friends easily and he was a true friend. Jared absolutely 
                        loved life. Jared will always be remembered for the special way he had of making people feel 
                        like they mattered. He brought out the best in people. Jared had a very gentle and loving soul. 
                        His teammates have shared stories with us about how Jared could turn a bad situation into a 
                        positive one. That’s how we knew Jared to be. He was kind, compassionate, trustworthy, and 
                        always remained true to himself—and he very much loved his family. Jared would have turned 
                        33 this year, just 6 days after that horrific day. So as you can only imagine, August is a very 
                        difficult month for the three of us, but we will always cherish the memories we have of Jared. 
                        He lived every day of his life to the absolute fullest, and he simply had fun. We want to thank 
                        each and every one of you for your kindness and for your determination in keeping Jared's 
                        memory alive.

                        <b>From Jared's Sister, Marie:</b><br>
                        When I was four years old, I received the best gift a child could ask 
                        for, a sibling. It was only Jared and I, so we were best friends growing up. I refer to Jared often 
                        as "Andy" or "Andy Boy." When we were very young, there was a commercial for Domino’s pizza 
                        with an ugly monkey-looking puppet with huge ears. The slogan for the pizza was "Good pizza, 
                        bad Andy." When the commercial came on, I told Jared he looked exactly like this puppet (which 
                        wasn't even close to looking like him) and it made him cry, and of course he would tattle on me 
                        to Mom and Dad. As a big sister, I certainly took advantage of tormenting my little brother, so 
                        this became his nickname: Andy. As we got older, he tolerated the nickname, and he actually 
                        liked it. I will always remember the dread I felt on September 11, 2001. Not only because of the 
                        horrific events that changed the world that day; but I felt what I can only call a premonition. 
                        Jared was joining the Navy in a matter of months and I felt an incredibly powerful dread that this 
                        day was somehow going to change my family’s lives in the future. When Jared was killed fighting 
                        the very group of people who devastated this country, those feelings from that day came back 
                        to me. I know in my heart that this was Jared's destiny, and I think I always somehow knew that 
                        this would be his calling. This gives me a sense of peace, but there isn't a day that goes by that 
                        my heart hurts for missing him terribly. Jared was always my ally, yet my biggest rival. He was 
                        my confidant, yet the first one to rat me out. He was my protector, and yet my biggest bully. We 
                        gave each other such joy, such grief, and many many laughs to last a lifetime. And I miss every 
                        single one of these moments. In our family, Jared was the joke-telling, always-laughing story 
                        teller. I understand this was also true in his military family. He is simply the funniest person I will 
                        ever meet. It sounds so cliche to say that he enjoyed life... but Jared enjoyed every single 
                        moment of his life. For me, enjoying life sounds ridiculous without having him here, but I know 
                        that Jared would want each one of us to continue on. To have the same passion for life, family, 
                        and loved ones. To keep laughing and always find the humor in life. That is the biggest honor we 
                        can give him. To continue his legacy. I am so blessed for all of you: his military family, who are 
                        now a part of our family. Spending time with you means more to us than we can put into words. 
                        It just makes us feel closer to Jared and that he is still around us. I will be eternally grateful for 
                        everything that each one of you has done for my family. And I am so thankful to know that Jared 
                        was surrounded by such incredible men and women. Thank you for honoring my brother and 
                        best friend today.

                        <b>His Joint Service Commendation Medal w/Valor Citation reads:</b><br>
                        Petty Officer First Class Jared W. Day, United States Navy, distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous achievement as a Mission Support Site Tactical Communicator for a Joint Task Force in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM from 24 February 2010 to 25 June 2010. During this period, Petty Officer First Class Day flawlessly managed tactical and garrison communications for a remote mission support site. On 2 May 2010, his actions under fire were critical in stopping a border checkpoint from being overrun by enemy fighters. After a four kilometer dismounted patrol through mountainous terrain, his element was engaged; by rocked propelled grenades and effective enemy small arms fire. Petty Officer First Class Day spotted and engaged enemy fighters and maneuvered with the ground force Commander while providing situational awareness to higher headquarters to coordinate reinforcements and close air support assets. His efforts ensured the successful execution of the mission and the safe extraction of all ground forces. The distinctive accomplishments of Petty Officer First Class Day reflect great credit upon him, the United States Navy, and the Department of Defense.
