                <h3>Remembering the Fallen</h3>
                <p>
                On 6 August 2011, a U.S. Boeing CH-47 Chinook military helicopter was shot down in the Wardak province, west of Kabul, Afghanistan. The resulting crash killed all 38 people on board: 25 American special operations personnel, five United States Army National Guard and Army Reserve crewmen, seven Afghan commandos, and one Afghan interpreter—as well as a U.S. military working dog. It is considered the worst loss of U.S. Military life in a single incident in the Afghanistan campaign.

                    Of the Navy SEALs who were killed 15 were members of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), The other two Navy SEALs killed in the helicopter shootdown were from a West Coast-based SEAL unit. The five other Navy personnel were NSW support personnel. In addition to the NSW losses, three AFSOC operators died in the crash, one Combat Controller and two Pararescuemen, all members of the 24th Special Tactics Squadron. Their deaths are the greatest single loss of life ever suffered by the U.S. Special Operations community in the 24-year history of the U.S. Special Operations Command.</p>
                <p>
                    These warriors answered the call to serve, placing themselves in harm's way to protect our nation and its values. Their sacrifice represents the highest form of service, and their memory will forever be etched in the hearts of a grateful nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We honor their memory, we remember their sacrifice, and we stand with their families who carry the profound weight of this loss. Their legacy lives on through the freedoms we enjoy and the values they defended with their lives.
