                <h3>Remembering the Fallen</h3>
                <p>
                    On this tragic day, our nation lost brave heroes who were serving with honor and distinction 
                    in defense of freedom. The helicopter crash in Wardak Province, Afghanistan, claimed the lives 
                    of dedicated service members who exemplified courage, sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to 
                    their mission and their brothers and sisters in arms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These warriors answered the call to serve, placing themselves in harm's way to protect our 
                    nation and its values. Their sacrifice represents the highest form of service, and their 
                    memory will forever be etched in the hearts of a grateful nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We honor their memory, we remember their sacrifice, and we stand with their families who 
                    carry the profound weight of this loss. Their legacy lives on through the freedoms we enjoy 
                    and the values they defended with their lives.
                </p>
