                    <p>
                        CW2 Bryan Joseph Nichols, 31, died August 6, 2011 near Combat Outpost Sayed Abad, Afghanistan due to hostile enemy action. Bryan was born October 16, 1979 in Hays, the son of Douglas and Cynthia (Karlin) Nichols. On October 7, 2006 he married Mary Hammerbacher in Frontenac, Kansas. Bryan was a 1998 graduate of TMP-Marian High School in Hays and enlisted in the in 1996. He was deployed twice in Iraq, once in 2002 and again in 2003, and once in Kosovo in 2004. He graduated flight school in 2008 and was a Chief Warrant Officer with the 7th Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment (General Support Aviation Battalion).</p>
                    <p>
                        A week ago, 10-year-old Braydon Nichols started to think about his dad and how much he missed him. Army Chief Warrant Officer Bryan Nichols, a helicopter pilot, had been deployed for two months in Afghanistan. The little boy, in the car with his mother running errands, brushed back his dirty-blond hair and ran his hand over his cheek. Jessica Nichols looked over when she heard sniffles. Her son was crying. "When is Dad coming back so we go camping?" he asked her. Soon, she assured him. "Your dad is off fighting for this country." The boy replied, "As soon as he gets home, we're going to go on a camping trip, just me and him."</p>
                    <p>
                        Jessica Nichols cannot stop replaying that scene in her mind. That's because only a few days later, on Saturday night, she was cradling her boy who was crying once again. Except this time she could not tell him that his father was coming home. She had just received a call informing her that Bryan Nichols was one of the 30 Americans who died that afternoon when their Chinook helicopter was shot down in Wardak province in east-central Afghanistan. "It was just so devastating that a week ago or so Braydon had that worried look on his face, thinking about his dad," she said. "Braydon and Bryan were so connected. Braydon was like a little version of his dad." "He always wanted to be in the Army," she said. "He came across the Chinook and was
                        so fascinated. His father flew Chinooks."</p>
                    <p>
                        Bryan Nichols did three deployments during their marriage. It proved to be too much for their relationship, she said. They divorced when Braydon was 3, but remained close to raise Braydon. Bryan remarried, and his new wife and Jessica all got along. They all loved and cared for Braydon, she said. It was Bryan's wife, Mary, who contacted Jessica Saturday night to say that Bryan had died. "She was screaming," Jessica said. "She was screaming that Bryan was dead." Jessica couldn't believe what she was hearing. She hung up. Her heart was beating hard. Braydon was in his room, still awake and playing. Jessica walked toward the room, and stood by his door for a moment, overcome with grief. "I went to my room and tried to figure out what was going on," she said. Jessica pulled herself together as best she could and phoned her brother who lives nearby. He came to her house to support her. Together, they called Braydon downstairs. In his pajamas, Braydon stood in front of his mother and uncle. "I said, 'Braydon, do you know much your dad loves you? Do you know how proud of you he is?" Before she could say anything more, the boy wilted in her arms, sobbing. "I said, 'I'm sorry ... your ... dad died."
