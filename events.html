                <p>
                    We invite you to join us for a solemn memorial ceremony honoring the 31 brave service members 
                    who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation. This annual gathering brings together 
                    families, friends, fellow veterans, and community members to remember, reflect, and pay tribute 
                    to those who gave their lives defending our freedoms.
                </p>
                <p>

                    opportunities to meet with Gold Star families. This is a time to come together as a community 
                    to ensure that the sacrifices of these heroes are never forgotten and that their legacies 
                    continue to inspire future generations.
